# 🧠 Project Risk Prediction Tool

A Streamlit web application that uses machine learning to predict the **risk level** of Agile software projects based on project characteristics such as duration, team size, sprint velocity, and more.

## 🔍 What It Does

This tool helps Agile teams and project managers estimate the **project risk level** (`Low`, `Medium`, or `High`) using an ML model trained on simulated project data. It considers multiple parameters like:

- Project duration
- Team size
- Sprint velocity
- Requirement changes
- Delay percentages
- Tech stack complexity
- Team experience
- Client communication score
